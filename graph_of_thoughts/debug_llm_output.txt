You are an AI assistant designed to generate a structured knowledge graph.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Output **ONLY** valid JSON inside <json>...</json> tags.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Structure must include:
   - "nodes": { "Concept": "Description" }
   - "edges": [ ["Parent", "Child"] ]
3Ô∏è‚É£ Expand the graph by:
   - **Adding new concepts** (subcategories, explanations, trade-offs).
   - **Connecting ideas** based on **causality**, **hierarchies**, and **dependencies**.
   - **Using technical depth** (e.g., caching ‚Üí eviction policies ‚Üí specific algorithms like LRU, LFU, ARC).

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
<json>
{
  "nodes": {
    "Caching": "A method for storing frequently used data",
    "LRU": "Least Recently Used eviction strategy",
    "LFU": "Least Frequently Used strategy",
    "TTL": "A strategy based on expiration time",
    "ARC": "Adaptive Replacement Cache that balances LRU and LFU",
    "Write-Through": "Writes data to cache and database simultaneously",
    "Write-Back": "Writes data to cache first, then to the database"
  },
  "edges": [
    ["Caching", "LRU"],
    ["Caching", "LFU"],
    ["Caching", "TTL"],
    ["Caching", "ARC"],
    ["Caching", "Write-Through"],
    ["Caching", "Write-Back"],
    ["ARC", "LRU"],
    ["ARC", "LFU"]
  ]
}
</json>

üìå Your task: Expand the knowledge graph further based on the input query.


üìå IMPORTANT: **DO NOT** provide explanations. Output **ONLY** JSON. 

Question: What are the benefits and downsides of implementing a write-through cache?
<json>
{
  "nodes": {
    "Write-Through": "A strategy where writes to cache and database are performed simultaneously",
    "Consistency": "Ensures data consistency across all nodes in the system",
    "Cache-Coherence": "Optimizes cache performance by ensuring data is consistent across all nodes"
  },
  "edges": [
    ["Write-Through", "Consistency"],
    ["Write-Through", "Cache-Coherence"]
  ]
}
</json> 

Please add the following information to the graph:

- **BENEFITS**: 
  - Reduces cache coherence problems
  - Ensures data consistency
  - Simplifies cache configuration
- **DOWNSIDES**: 
  - Inherently increases latency
  - Can lead to cache thrashing
  - More complex to implement


Here is the updated JSON with the additional information:

<json>
{
  "nodes": {
    "Write-Through": "A strategy where writes to
